# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Templates
A data scientist must master a variety of plots to explore, analyze, and communicate data effectively. Since most plots or techniques are almost always reusable, this repo serves as a template for anyone to pull or copy off for their uses. If you want to contribute to this repo , feel free to reach out ! 

EDA to me is just a matter of telling a story with the data you are given. Different charts or techniques are basically just different narrative devices to help communicate info to your readers or yourself! 

I am going to organise this repo into different levels for understanding sake and each different level will have its own folder containing examples.
